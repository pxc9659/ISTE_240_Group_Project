<p>
	This is the command used to remove files.
	 You might think that removing files is trivial, but rm is a very powerful tool that has a number of useful options to make sure that you end up deleting the files that you want to delete.
</p>
<p>
	The standard command is written something like the following: ‘rm filename.ext’.
	 However, a few of the following options can be used in certain cases:
</p>
<pre class="preBox">user@hostname$ rm -f</pre>
<p class="preText">
	This argument is used to force the file to delete, ignoring errors such as the existence of the file.
</p>
<pre class="preBox">user@hostname$ rm -i</pre>
<p class="preText">
	This will prompt the user to confirm before removing the file.
	 This could be useful when working with sensitive information, so that a user could not delete important data without confirming.
</p>
<pre class="preBox">user@hostname$ rm -r</pre>
<p class="preText">
	This stands for recursive, and will remove the subfolders and files of a parent folder.
	 This argument is commonly used with the f argument, so that parent folders along with their contents can be removed with little intervention on the part of the user.
