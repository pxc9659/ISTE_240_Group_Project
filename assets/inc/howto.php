<h2>How to use this site</h2>
<hr>
<p>We found that Linux tutorial sites that offered a good range of accessible content were hard to come by. Most people just end up searching their problems on Google Therefore, we set out to make a website thathas all the basics of UNIX commands available in an easily accessible format.</p>
<p>To get the most out of this site, please follow the below instructions. We promise it won't take long.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the left navigation bar to traverse through our different modules. If you are a beginner, read the module list top to bottom. If you just need to touch up on certain topics, feel free to navigate through the modules and look at the topics you wish to learn.</li>
	<li>There are quizzes for each module. The quizzes are designed to be taken either before starting a module (for you to check your understanding of the concepts detailed in the module) or after reading a module (for you to see what you should continue learning).</li>
	<li>Please feel free to leave us any feedback regarding the site on the comments page.</li>
